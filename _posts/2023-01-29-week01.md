title: Week 1: Getting started into the area of Open Source Software Development
---


•	open source (what do YOU think about when you hear the term "open source"? what are some advantages of open vs. closed source, what are some potential problems with open source, why did you decide to register for a class about open-source software development?)__
•	projects: briefly talk about four open-source projects that you regularly use or that influenced you in some way in the past (note, the projects do not have to be source code based) (Keep in mind that these blogs are publicly available to anybody who stumbles upon them. Make sure that the posts are appropriate.)


The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one.
