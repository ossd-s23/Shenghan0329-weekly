title: Week 16, Reports on FreeCodeCamp and Discussion on Chrispher Snider's presentation
---



In Wednesday's lecture, Chrispher made a presentation on the open-source project he is working on. Before the presentation, I think the concept of making healthcare industry open-source is great. After the presentation, <!--more-->I think this concept is great as well. In addition, his presentation clearly gave me an idea what his project is about and how does it function. 

Personally I am looking forwards to see how open-source could change the healthcare industry in the United States. In my two years living in America, the thing I had most trouble with and complained the most about was the medical system: in my personal experience, doctors can do whatever they want to their patient, even without their acknowledgement, without any risks to themselves for the immoral actions. Meanwhile, if someone in the medical system made a mistake whether intentionally or not in the billing amount, it would take huge efforts for both the patient and the healthcare company to figure out the problem. Every time I faced such a problem as a patient, I missed China's medical system, in which the government took care of almost everything (the price a patient pays is super cheap) as long as a Chinese citizen pays 100 dollars per year. 

However, under a free market economy in US, solution like that cannot be feasible. Chrispher's presentation gave me an alternative with completely different idea: instead of centralizing the system, we can make it transparent through open-source. Ideally open-source projects listen to the users, thus are open to improvements in user experiences. This feature is very hard for a centralized project. Meanwhile, being transparent can largely reduce uncertainty for patients, largely reducing the frequency of the common situation in US, in which a patient receive a surprisingly expensive bill after going the the doctor's. I love the idea of making healthcare open-source.

After looking at users' comments on Tidepool, I realize there might be some difficulties in such an open-source project. Recently many users complain about the functionalities of the software, as opposed to the praisals of its concept when the app was firstly published. Still, I'm very excited to see how open-source can contribute to the healthcare industry, since it's a very new concept and can solve many problems brought by intransparency in the traditional healthcare system. 

For the progress of our group working on FreeCodeCamp, we have identified an issue we could potentially work on. The reason is that the maintainers are still having a conversation about whether a change should be applied. In addition, someone has made a pull request to a issue we wanted to work on, so we are looking for more issues to work on. In this week, there aren't new issues we can work on, so we are trying to find additional issues within old issues.
